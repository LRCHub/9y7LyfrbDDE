Stars, they are like a gateway
It seems my heart just slightly
melts away
This atmosphere just gains its
gravity
I kind of want to see that night
again
Hey,
can you take me to the Milky
Way?
Wanna leave this planet right
away
This train will take us to
the stairway now
It makes me wonder how to dance
We are in the time to dump our
prior phase
That was just us in the past of
early days
Now is the time to leave them
miles away
Just say it,
we gotta build our life again
Hey,
can you take me to the Milky
Way?
Wanna leave this planet right
away
This train will take us to
the stairway now
It makes me wonder how to dance
Shooting star,
you are dying right now
So tell us where we are in this
sky that changes so fast
I just want to give you your
best ending
You're only light for me
(One true delight for me)
Shining brightly just for me
(Just like a fantasy)
I just can't wait to be together
with you
Now it's my turn to jump and fly
away
Stars,
they are falling on the street
Those people cry out like
bumblebee
Their mind will sooner get blown
away, yeah
I kind of want to see them burn
away
Shooting star,
you are dying right now
So tell us where we are in this
sky that changes so fast
I just want to give you your
best ending
You're only light for me
(One true delight for me)
Shining brightly just for me
(Just like a fantasy)
I just can't wait to be together
with you
Now it's my turn to jump and fly
away
We'll give up our joyful former
days to wipe out their selfish
fantasy
Their buzz doesn't matter
anymore
Let's leave it,
we'll have our time together
straight away
We are in the time to dump our
prior phase
That was just us in the past of
early days
Now is the time to leave them
miles away
Just say it,
we gotta build our life again
We are in the time to dump our
prior phase
That was just us in the past of
early days
Now is the time to leave them
miles away
Just say it,
we gotta build our life again
